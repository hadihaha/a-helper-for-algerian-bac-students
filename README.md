## 📖 Project Overview

### The Preface
Preparing for the BAC exam in Algeria is often a battle against information overload. The primary challenge isn't just the difficulty of the material—it is the **process of acquiring, organizing, and filtering resources.** this is an app currently under active development, built by university students to solve this. We aim to take off the mental burden and stress by providing a centralized, "all-in-one" toolkit for the journey toward success.

## 🛠️ Features (The Student Toolkit)

### 1. 📝 Smart Notes Taker
A focused Markdown-enabled tool that allows students to capture essential information on the fly. We've moved beyond simple text to include visual organization:
* **Status Tracking:** Mark concepts as `Done` (strikethrough).
* **Urgency Levels:** Color-coded `Urgent` (Red) flags for topics needing immediate review.
* **Highlighting:** `Key Concepts` (Yellow) for easy scanning during final revisions.

* **Targeted Practice:** Filter by **Branch** (filière) and specific **Lessons**.
* **Instant Solutions:** Every generated exercise comes with its detailed solution, eliminating the search for answer keys.
